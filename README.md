# Star-Wars-Movie-Project
While waiting for Star Wars: The Force Awakens, i was interested in answering some questions about Star Wars fans. One question that particularly interested me was: Does the rest of America realize that “The Empire Strikes Back” is clearly the best of the bunch?
In this project, cleaning and exploring of the star wars movie dataset is done with the help of Jupyter.
Data is collected through SurveyMonkey, an online survey tool, to survey Star Wars fans.

•	Worked on several standard python packages like Numpy, matPlotLib, Scipy, wxPython, PyTables etc
